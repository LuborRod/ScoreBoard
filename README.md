PHP Scoreboard Component

A lightweight, framework-independent PHP component for managing game scores using DDD approach. 
100% test coverage.

Notes - 

1) The use of SplObjectStorage in the Scoreboard Component is a deliberate design choice to ensure framework independence and to rely solely on native PHP implementations.

2) What TODO next?  When updating the score, ensure that the new score is greater than the previous score, as decreasing values are not permitted.
